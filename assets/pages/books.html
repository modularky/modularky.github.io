        <h3>Book I: Phantasm Demontia - Modulation</h3>
        <p>
          Completed webnovel!<br>
          It follows a rather boring lazy man from our world who is granted godlike powers, only to watch his world turn to dust.
          Then he was forced to go to another world, much like his own, only to be revered as the inhabitant's god.
          Reliving the memories of others shows him not only what he could have been but what he is about to become.

          <em>Excerpt, Chapter 7:</em><br />
          "The beam pierced the Earth and shattered it into a cloud of colorful dust. Not an explosion, not an implosion. 
          An impossible phenomenon. Then the magnificent beast took in a breath, the colorful dust particles sucked into its gaping maw. 
          The once vibrant world was reduced to a faint glimmer of what it had been."
